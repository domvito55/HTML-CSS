            <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. 
                Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen size bed with down quit and gas-fired stove. 
                    Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and 
                    cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather 
                    with light layers of clothing. It is also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of 
                    adventure!
